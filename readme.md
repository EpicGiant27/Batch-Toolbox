# Batch Toolkit
This is a set of batch programs or "tools" that I have decided to compile into one* batch file.
*: It actually uses another batch file to make to pause code shorter but ignore that lmao
# Calculator
The calculator is a basic batch calculator.
Due to limitations of batch, the calculator only outputs integers.
This is due to the fact that "/set a %yourvariablename%=%yourequation%" (the method for maths in batch) only outputs integers.
Sorry.

TO USE:
Select it from the menu, type a sum in and press enter.
